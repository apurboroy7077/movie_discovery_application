# 🎬 Movie Discovery Application

Hello **Bhaia**,

We have completed the frontend project you asked us to make. Due to time limitations, I could not implement all the requested features. However, I believe the features I have completed are enough to demonstrate my skills and capabilities.

I kept the UI simple on purpose, and I would like to mention that **all pages are fully responsive**.
